Code of Conduct
===============

Hey there! Our project thrives on being open, friendly, and always up for some insightful discussions.

Our goal is to make sure everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their background or expertise. We truly appreciate everyone's contributions!

When it comes to making decisions, we rely on technical know-how and reaching a consensus together.

Remember, contributing to the project doesn't just mean writing code. There are so many other fantastic ways to get involved, like reviewing pull requests, lending a hand on mailing lists or issue boards, organizing tutorials, working on the website, or even improving the documentation. Every single effort counts and is truly priceless!

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/
