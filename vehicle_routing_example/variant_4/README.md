# Variant 4

This variant implements the pipeline shown in pipeline_to_implement.svg.

In this variant, the resulting pipeline modeling should be closer to the result of my master thesis 
to the extent that the selection of the config is tied to the selection of the scoring method 
(or vice versa, depending on what is more comprehensible to model).
